# Connect4 - Minimax

This folder has a Connect4 Game project in which the user plays againts a minimax bot. Its heuristic and the fact that I did not use numpy matrices holds back the project a little.
I may be making changes to the project in the future to make the game look nicer and to implement other changes and improve the bot.
For now it will just be a reference for an example of the implementation of the minimax algorithm.

To run the project, make sure the following steps are/were done:
 - installed one of the latest versions of python (3.10 should be enough);
      if not type in your terminal the equivalent to mine on ubuntu:
